# Project Name: Ruby Bubble Sort

## Brief description

-In this project we implemented the bubble sort algorithim, bubble_sort, using Ruby. We also implemented another algorithm, bubble_sort_by, that does bubble sort. However, bubble_sort_by uses the ruby keyword "yield" to enable bubble_sort_by to accept a block and its return value. The return value is used for sorting the elements passed to bubble_sort_by.
